                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer, my motto is "build software focusing on performance and maintainability".
                    Throughout my studying years I've been able to experience numerous different technologies,
                    both in desktop application development and web development.
                    My main goal is to get my first experience as an actual programmer,
                    and later on be recognized for my awesome work.

                <h3>Forex Trading App</h3>
                <p>
                    The Forex Trading App is a simulated platform meticulously
                    crafted to replicate the experience of forex trading.
                    In the world of forex, participants buy and sell currencies
                    with the expectation of value appreciation. Our app mirrors this process,
                    utilizing a websockets API to provide real-time values for both GDP and USD currencies.
                    Additionally, it offers user-friendly features, including registration,
                    login, and validation functionalities for a comprehensive trading simulation experience.
                </p>
                <p>Tech Stack: TypeScript, Node, React, Express, MongoDB, REST APIs, WebSockets API</p>
